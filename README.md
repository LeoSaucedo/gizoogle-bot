# gizoogle-bot
A Twitter robot that translates tweets automatically.
[@GizoogleBot](https://www.twitter.com/GizoogleBot)

## Usage
Whenever a person tweets [@GizoogleBot](https://www.twitter.com/GizoogleBot), this python robot translates the tweet and tweets it back to them.
This robot includes a delay in order to comply with Twitter guidelines, so not all tweets may be translated.

## Setup
In order to create your own Gizoogle bot, you must have a file named `auth_tokens.txt`, and place your tokens *in order*. This allows my code to accurately get its auth keys. For further detail, check the code. 

### Special thanks
The Gizoogle translator, one of the most important parts of the program, was derived from [AwwCookies' Gist](https://gist.github.com/AwwCookies/9996819).

Additionally, an obvious tip of the hat to [Gizoogle.net](http://gizoogle.net/) for making all of this possible.
