# gizoogle-bot
A Twitter robot that translates tweets automatically.

## Usage
Whenever a person tweets @GizoogleBot or #GizoogleThis, this python robot translates the tweet and tweets it back to them.
This robot includes a delay in order to comply with Twitter guidelines, so not all tweets may be translated.

## Setup
In order to create your own Gizoogle bot, you must have a file named `auth_tokens.txt`, and place your tokens *in order*. This allows my code to accurately get its auth keys.
